                            My journey as a Software Developer started back in 2019 when I graduated college. I left UW-Madison with a degree in Genetics and a greater interest in coding. After graduation, I looked forward to pursuing my passion for software development and searched for opportunities to progress my knowledge. Fast forward 3 years, one bootcamp, and thousands of lines of code later, Iâ€™m ready to dive into the industry I love, and establish a presence as a part of something greater.
